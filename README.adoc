== The Neo4j-core Ruby driver

This example demonstrates how to use https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core[neo4j-core] to execute cypher queries.

Basically, this is a simple Sinatra application, providing a number of endpoints `/graph`, `/search` and `/movie`.
These execute hard-coded Cypher queries against the Neo4j Server backend, and parse the results to provide JSON responses to the frontend JavaScript code.
