== The Neo4j-core Ruby driver

This example demonstrates how to use https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core[neo4j-core] to execute cypher queries.

Basically, this is a simple Sinatra application, providing a number of endpoints `/graph`, `/search` and `/movie`.
These execute hard-coded Cypher queries against the Neo4j Server backend, and parse the results to provide JSON responses to the frontend JavaScript code.

=== How to Install


[source,bash]
----
bundle install
----

=== How to run


    # with rackup
    NEO4J_USERNAME=username NEO4J_PASSWORD=password bundle exec rackup config.ru

    # with shotgun for for development / reloading
    gem install shotgun
    NEO4J_USERNAME=username NEO4J_PASSWORD=password bundle exec shotgun config.ru

If your neo4j server is not running on `localhost:7474` then you can specify an
alternate location with an environment variable named `NEO4J_URL`.
